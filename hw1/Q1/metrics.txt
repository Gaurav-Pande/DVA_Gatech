1.Average node degree (run the function called “Average Degree”)
-> 1.62
--> I think average degree means sum of degree of all node divided by total number of nodes, so that we get on an average what o
is the degree per node here

Diameter of the graph (run the function called “Network Diameter”)
-> 16
I think it is the maximum distance between any two nodes in the graph as also mention when we click on the run diameter button.
So in a graph this should be the distance between 2 nodes which are farthest apart. No 2 other nodes are this much far.

Average path length (run the function called “Avg. Path Length”)
--> 4.823
This should be the average distance between 2 nodes i guess. I think minimum distance between 2 nodes is 1 and the diameter is
the maximum distance, so average path length should give us an idea about the statistical distribution of the path length i guess.
