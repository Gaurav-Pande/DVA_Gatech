Q3.1

Linear Regression - 
	Training Accuracy:86
	Testing Accuracy:82

SVM -
	Training Accuracy:98
	Testing Accuracy:96

MLP - 
	Training Accuracy:98
	Testing Accuracy:77

Random Forest - 
	Training Accuracy:99
	Testing Accuracy: 95

Q3.2 - Hyperparameter tuning

Random Forest - 
	n_estimators values tested (at least 3): [5,15,25]

	max_depth values tested (at least 3):  [5,15,25]
		
	Best combination of parameter values:
		n_estimators: 25
		max_depth: 25

	Testing Accuracy before tuning (default parameters):95
	Testing Accuracy after tuning:97


SVM -
	Kernels values tested: rbf, linear
	C values tested (at least 3): [0.1,0.01,0.001]
		
	Best combination of parameter values: 
		Kernel: rbf
		C: 0.1

	Testing Accuracy before tuning (default parameters):96
	Testing Accuracy after tuning:96

Q3.3

For your SVM's CV run from Q4.2, state the highest mean testing accuracy 
across the sets of parameter values and its corresponding mean train score and mean fit time. 

SVM's highest mean testing/cross-validated accuracy (best score):96
SVM's mean train score:88
SVM's mean fit time:0.393595437209

Q3.4

Best Classifier:RandomForest
Why: I think RandomForest performed best because:
- Among all the classifiers RandomForest shows the Best accuracy score on the testing data of 97 % although before the
tunning SVM shows higher accuracy of 96 percent, but overall RandomForest is efficient in this experiment with the
tunning of hyper parameters
