2. I think that feature combination 1 (Wins+Noms Vs IMDb Rating) is better as it gives a clear indication of the good vs bad movies Witch
respect to the number of nomination and wins, moreover it shows that blue dots have larger Wins+Noms as compared to the Red dots(bad movie).e

Square Root Scale:

Square root scale can be applied when we want to plot data with large values to be mapped in a small domain.
Key point of this scale in comparision to log is scale is that we can use the 0 values as well, whereas in log
scale we can't use 0 values as log(0) is undefined.
But it cannot be applied to negative values.

Log Scale:

Log scale is suitable if for variables with some outliers.
It makes an exponential relation as linear(x=e^y ==> y = logx).
We cannot use this scale for:
1. value 0
2. for negative values, as log(negative) is also undefined.
